# Chat Portfolio

A chat-based personal portfolio website where visitors can ask questions about my education, experience, projects, and skills — presented in a conversational UI inspired by ChatGPT and Claude.

## Vision
Instead of a static portfolio, this project aims to create an interactive, conversational experience that reflects how modern users explore information.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Rule-based chat logic (no external AI model)
- GitHub Pages for deployment
